# Abhishek Prasad

This is my portfolio repository, in which I update the accolades that I accomplish or contribute to. 

#### Things to update:

* Add a section of hackathons I've participated in.
* bring in coding videos that I publish often.


#### Blogposts that I need to work on:

* How was my experience winning the Facebook developer community hackathon
* How was my experience travelling to a new city and participating in a hackathon

Hopefully I can get some things done. In the meantime if others can comment/get in touch/mentor me in any way, kindly get in touch with me.
